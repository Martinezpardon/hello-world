Ever since last week wednesday i have been reading a book called Atomic habit, I i really enjoyed reading this one.
It offers very good advise on how daily smalls steps can exponancially increase a persons productivity.
It talks about setting a goal and breading it down to small manageable tasks and work on these small tasks every day, 
and also setting out a specific time in your day where you keep distractions like phones,friends and tv away to work on your goals.
The is alot of sound and logical advise im planning on using on this boootcamp to improve my work to stand a goood chance to be selected into the learneship
